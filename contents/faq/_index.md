The fee is calculated according to the following rules: from Ethereum to NewChain, the fee is double the ETH transfer fee and double the NEW transfer fee; from NewChain to Ethereum, the fee is double the NEW transfer fee and double the ETH transfer fee. In the case of ERC20/NRC6 type of pass, the transfer fee is calculated by converting the market price to the pass principal. Due to the volatility of the market, there may be deviations, NewBridge will adjust the fees from time to time, NewBridge itself does not earn any fees from users.
